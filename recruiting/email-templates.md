# Meetups Talk Submission

Dear ____________,

This message is regarding a request to submit (or sponsor) a talk at _____________.

First, let me thank you for everything you guys are doing hosting the group. As the co-organizer of the Portland Big Data group, which I've been trying to revive lately, I know how much work that is. I truly admire your efforts and congratulate you for organizing and moderating one of the liveliest groups.

Second, I like to seek your interest in allowing me to host an intro to Data Engineering talk. My team and I work behind an online data engineering educational and enablement site called [DataStack Academy](http://datastack.academy). We have a lot of (free) material to train folks on modern Cloud data engineering tools and skills that we like to share with your group. 

Our talk starts with a brief overview of the data engineering field... what exactly is a data engineer... skills required… day-to-day life… and why is it important to be trained in modern cloud data engineering techniques. 

After the intro, we can follow up with a live tutorial/demo on one of the following topics of your choice:

- Intro to Serverless data pipelines using GCP Cloud Functions
- How to use Docker & Kubernetes to build micro-service based data pipelines on GCP
- Data pipeline orchestration with Apache Airflow and GCP Cloud Composer 
- Processing data at scale with Apache Spark and GCP Dataproc - Intro to Spark
- Stream processing with GCP Pub/Sub (Kafka) and Serverless Cloud Functions

- OR one of the following introductory topics: intro to python pandas, SQL, GCP BigQuery, or simply cloud computing and google cloud!

We would like to conclude the talk by a brief promotion for our upcoming Data Engineering Bootcamp in January of 2022 in Portland, OR (the bootcamp will most likely be hosted online due to the pandemic).


Please let me know if you would like to host us? We can schedule a time to discuss more. 

Many thanks,
-Parham


Founder, DataStack Academy
