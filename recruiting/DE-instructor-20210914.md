# Company Description

Data Stack Academy (datastack.academy) is a Data Engineering bootcamp startup. We aim to be the main
hub for preparing people to start their data engineering career. Currently Data Engineering is the 
#1 in-demand IT job on Indeed with the highest average salary within tech. While there are a lot of 
bootcamp programs around data science and web development, there are only few resources available for
data engineering. Our program teaches modern Cloud architecture and tools to enable people to get into
this highly sought after market. 

We are launching our  first bootcamp in partnership with a well established local PDX bootcamp 
school. We are seeking a highly skilled instructor to be able to deliver the course. We are seeking
candidates with existing data engineering skills (python, pandas, spark, sql, gcp...) who are 
interested in teaching others. In this position, you will help us build, test, and deliver the course.
Any existing experience with Google Cloud and other data engineering tools (noted before) is a huge 
plus; but if you really have a neck for training and willing to learn fast, don't hesitate to apply.

Data Stack Academy is backed bu Tura.io, a local PDX Cloud and Data Engineering consulting company.
Those of us who have developed the course are senior Cloud data engineers & data architects. We work 
as consultants with customers across the globe in our day-to-day job. Data Stack Academy has been our
passion project for the last 2 years. We like to train people what we do; to start a new career in a very
stable sector of tech for those who have struggled in life!
