# Marketing Hire
Hey!
We’re looking for a part-time creatively  intelligent and highly enthusiastic marketing person. 

We, DataStack Academy (http://datastack.academy), are about to launch a 25 wks long intense Data Engineering Bootcamp starting January 3rd, 2022. The bootcamp will be hosted in partnership with Epicodus, a local web development bootcamp. We need part-time help to promote, raise awareness, and drive up admissions. Activities include:

- Working with graphic designer and web developer to revamp the website geared towards the bootcamp
- Marketing copy for the website, flyers, and other promotional materials
- Seeking meetups and user groups to schedule talks and presentations
- Organizing bi-weekly webinars
- Lead generation and weekly newsletters
- Posting and marketing on social media platforms
- Seek creative ways to find users

The current site is geared towards online self-learners and we’ll be completely revamping the landing page towards this new bootcamp program.

We already have a well-defined marketing plan but would really appreciate your professional help to sharpen the plan and drive the day-to-day activities. 



# Web Developer Post


Hey! We need to revamp our homepage to reflect the launch of our new Data Engineering Bootcamp offering. Our current site is http://DataStack.academy and we're launching a new 25wks long bootcamp program starting Jan 3rd, 2022. 

The existing site is based on Next.js and is hosted on Vercel. Everything is in standard and reusable React/Next.js components. We already have a mockup ready to go. It should be pretty straightforward. You'll be working alongside a marketing person for any website content/copy and our graphic designer for any graphic needs.


Initially we just need small changes to promote the new bootcamp program. Only adding new content blocks and rearranging elements. You need to have a good eye for design and be an expert on CSS and layout. 

In scope work includes:
- Adding and change homepage content blocks
- Integration with google analytics & mailchimp for lead capture
- Sign up form

Additional changes & follow up work could include:
- Adding an easily updatable events section
- Calendly integration for prospects to schedule a time with our staff
- Ability to upload recorded videos of past events


We're looking to launch ASAP, need someone to be able to crank this out in 2-3 wks. 

We'll be able to give you read access to the git repo for better estimate of work. 

Bonus points for people who are good with animations (especially something like GSAP), but that's not necessarily necessary right away.
