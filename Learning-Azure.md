## Services

A short of list of main services and why they are preferred:

- **Azure App Service**: host web apps in python, node, c# to host REST APIs
- **Azure Functions**: Serverless micro-services that respond to HTTP requests, cloud events, or run in an schedule. Easiest way to write 
- **Azure Monitor**: A service that helps you to visualize, query, route, archive, and act on the metrics and logs that you generate with 
  your Azure resources. Monitor is the single source for monitoring Azure resources.
- **Azure Container Instances**: Run docker instances on the cloud 
- **Azure Kubernetes Services**: Run k8s clusters
- **Azure Cosmos DB**: document based & graph based database. Similar to MongoDB.
- **Azure SQL**: Azure-based version of SQL Server with support for TSQL.
