# Iran Manifesto
-----------------------------------------------------------

- I like to look into an Iranian kid's face, witness the smile on their face and know that I had something to contribute to that smile.

- I want a young woman in Iran to believe they have every bit of an opportunity in this life as a man. I want them to believe they have equal employment and equal human rights.

- I want to bear witness to the glance of hope in my Iranian _hamvatan_ face. Know that I had something to do with that.

- I want Iranians to be proud in this World; in their work, in their image. I want them to be proud, knowing that they are the best in their field and others globally recognize that. A technical field completely removed from oil. I want Iran to be as synonymous with this field as Germans with Cars, Swiss with watches, or Japanese with design and intricacy.

- I want someone to raise their head and say they're Iranian when they check into a hotel on their vacation somewhere in the World.

- I want Iranians to have a comfortable life in Iran, live with their families, preserve and advocate for their rich culture.

- I want my kids (if any) to know of Persian soil and to be proud of walking it.

## Practice to stay in trust
  1. When you move into struggle/trust issues, 
  1. get out in nature, get physical, listen to music.  
  1. Move into listening -- hear the spiritual call, nudge


  Remember the feelings you get when you are back in trust:  
  - Chest feels lighter/ease/
  - nothing can happen that is not for your highest good, 
  - see myself as a third person.

  Invite your partner to support you in remaining in trust.

# PPP Loan - Round 2
-----------------------------------------------

## 25% calculation:
https://bench.co/blog/operations/25-reduction-ppp/


**Documents Needed:**

If you file IRS Form 1120-S (S-Corp) or Form 1120 (C-Corp)

You must upload all of the following:

## 1120-S as S-Corp filing

- 2019 or 2020* (whichever you used to calculate loan amount) IRS Wage and Tax Statements (such as IRS Form 940, IRS Form W-3, or IRS Form W-2s) or equivalent payroll processor records or IRS Form 941 and state quarterly wage unemployment insurance tax reporting form from each quarter

- 2019 or 2020* (whichever you used to calculate loan amount.) IRS Form 1120, IRS 1120-S

- Records of any retirement or health insurance contributions

- 2020 Q1 IRS Form 941, a payroll statement or similar documentation from the pay period that covered February 15, 2020 to establish you were in operation and had employees on that date

## Lost of Revenue

**Quarterly financial statements for the entity**. If the financial statements are not audited, the applicant must sign and date the first page of the financial statement and initial all other pages, attesting to their accuracy. If the financial statements do not specifically identify the line item(s) that constitute gross receipts, the applicant must annotate which line item(s) constitute gross receipts.

Annual IRS income tax filings of the entity (required if using an annual reference period). If the entity has not yet filed a tax return for 2020, the applicant must fill out the return forms, compute the relevant gross receipts value, and sign and date the return, attesting that the values that enter into the gross receipts, computation are the same values that will be filed on the entityâ€™s tax return.

**Quarterly or monthly bank statements for the entity showing deposits from the relevant quarters**. The applicant must annotate, if it is not clear, which deposits listed on the bank statement constitute gross receipts (e.g., payments for purchases of goods and services) and which do not (e.g., capital infusions).
